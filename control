Description: A mailer for hosts without permanent internet connection
 MasqMail is an MTA (mail transport agent) and POP3 client for hosts
 that don't have a permanent internet connection, eg. a home network
 or a single host at home and notebooks. It has special support for
 connections to different ISPs.
 .
 In these cases, MasqMail is a slim replacement for full-blown MTAs
 such as sendmail, exim, qmail or postfix. The POP3 client can be
 a small replacement for other full-featured tools like fetchmail.
