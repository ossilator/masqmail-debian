Masqmail for Debian
-------------------

This is the Debian package of my Masqmail MTA.

Masqmail is an MTA specially designed for hosts with intermittent
internet connections, i.e. hosts (or networks) at home or notebooks. It has
special support for changing providers. It works both for sending mail
(replacing exim, sendmail, postfix or qmail) and receiving mail (replacing
fetchmail, but it also works in conjunction with fetchmail).

Special support for 'changing providers' means individual configurations
depending on the current connection to the internet and rewriting of sender
addresses.

It has been compiled with the options:
                --prefix=/usr --mandir='$${prefix}/share/man' \
                --datadir='$${prefix}/share' \
                --with-logdir=/var/log/masqmail \
                --with-spooldir=/var/spool/masqmail \
                --with-user=mail --with-group=mail \
                --with-confdir=/etc/masqmail \
                --with-liblockfile \
                --enable-auth \
                --enable-ident \
                --enable-maildir

i.e. with ESMTP AUTH support, with ident support and with Maildir support.

You will find all information necessary to configure Masqmail in the man
pages masqmail (8), masqmail.conf (5), masqmail.route (5), masqmail.get (5)
and masqmail.aliases (5). Its configuration files live in the directory
/etc/masqmail/ and in /etc/aliases.
